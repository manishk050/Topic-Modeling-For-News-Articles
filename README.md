üì∞ Topic Modeling for News Articles
Welcome to the Topic Modeling for News Articles project! This repository contains a complete pipeline to perform topic modeling on a collection of news articles. The goal is to uncover hidden thematic structures in the text data, providing insights into the most common topics discussed in the news.

üöÄ Project Overview
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and unsupervised machine learning techniques to automatically discover topics within a large set of news articles. The key focus is on using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling.

Key Components
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis.
LDA Topic Modeling: Implementing the LDA algorithm to identify topics.
Visualization: Presenting the results through clear and informative visualizations.
üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure
Here's an overview of the files in this repository:

Project.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing the entire process, including data preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
app.py: A Python script that deploys the topic modeling results as a web application.
cleanednewsarticles.csv: The cleaned dataset used for topic modeling.
Topic Modeling for news articles.pptx: A presentation file summarizing the project, methods, and findings.
project.html: An HTML version of the notebook for easy viewing in a web browser.
python.docx: A document file, likely containing explanations, code snippets, or additional documentation related to the project.
stop_words.txt: A text file listing stop words that were removed from the text data during preprocessing.
üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/manishk050/Topic-Modeling-For-News-Articles.git
cd Topic-Modeling-For-News-Articles
2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook to follow the complete analysis:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open Project.ipynb to explore the full workflow, from preprocessing the text data to visualizing the topics.
4. Deploy the Web Application
If you want to see the topic modeling results in a web app format:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Then, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser to interact with the app.

5. Explore the Presentation
For a summary and presentation of the project, refer to the Topic Modeling for news articles.pptx file.

üìä Results
The results of the topic modeling, including the key topics and their representative keywords, are visualized within the notebook. You can interact with these visualizations to gain deeper insights into the topics present in the dataset.

üìù Additional Documentation
stop_words.txt: Contains a list of stop words that were excluded from the analysis to improve the quality of the topics.
project.html: An HTML version of the notebook, which is helpful for sharing the analysis without requiring a Jupyter environment.
